       <P> Among other sectors, the hospitality industry is unique in both its depth and 
prevalence in daily life. Hospitality plays a major role in both leisure and 
business, from lodging such as hotels and guest houses to catering and 
entertainment to tour operators and cruise operators. A very limited number 
of companies, a handful of major names, dominate most industries. 
However, since hospitality is so diverse, the number of well-known 
companies involved is also impressively high, including multinational hotel 
and restaurant chains, airline companies and many.
 In the service industry, the contrast between perceptions and experiences 
is the product of a customer's perceived service quality. Research shows 
that employee satisfaction is not related to a particular category of quality, 
but depends on the capacity of the hotel to fulfill customer standards. Even 
if research on this subject is scarce, a few studies indicate that the category 
of classification is a measure of price rather than quality in the hotel sector. 
Prices and stars may be variables that decide perceptions from the point of 
view of the consumer
