    <h2>WHY BEE RESORT?</h2>
    <img src="img/Logo_20230823_230355.jpeg" alt="beeresortbanner">
    <P>We can say that a Resort is a self-contained establishment, providing for most of a vacationer's needs while remaining on 
        the premises (lodging, food, drink, sports, entertainment, shopping, etc.). 
        The ownership can vary between timeshare, fractionally owned or operated by a single company.</P>
    <p2>Think about your own experiences as a consumer. How often do you make a quick 
        assumption about a brand or business, after merely a quick glance at their website? When was the last time 
        a brand really "spoke" to you?
     Now, think like a business owner: You have a five-star experience to offer, don't you?
