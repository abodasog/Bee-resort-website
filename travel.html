                the daily purpose of the Travelodge. Because than half of the workers are international students in Travelodge. But due to the changing
                 rules and regulation, the under graduate students dont get work permit from 2012 and those workers must leave the job at once. Last time
                when there was a great festival of Nepalese people the 50% of 
                Travelodge in UK were in shortage of housekeepers because most of those international workers and students went back to there country 
                for celebrating their festival. So the changing regulation might affect the smoothness of Travelodge because more than half of the workers 
                are international students in almost every Travelodge.</p>
